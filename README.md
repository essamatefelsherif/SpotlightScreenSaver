# SpotlightScreenSaver

A basic windows screensaver. Displays a digital clock centered across the virtual desktop. If you only have one monitor you have nothing to worry about, but those with two or more may notice oddities.

The desktop becomes black and parts are "illuminated" by a randomly moving light spot
